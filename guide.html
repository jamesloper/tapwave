<h2 class="entry-title">Zodiac Game Install Guide</h2>
	<p>For the longest time we all used to use <b>HotSync</b>, a program similar to iTunes to set up and install files to the Zodiac. Honestly, today's method is actually a bit easier.</p>
	<p>Many apps are packaged as just a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRC_(Palm_OS)" target="_blank">.prc</a> and possibly a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDB_(Palm_OS)" target="_blank">.pdb</a> file as well. Just copy these to <b>/PALM/Launcher</b> on your SD card and you're good to go.</p>
	<p>If an app has a required game data folder there will also be a folder in the download. It will have a name like <b>Zod-fcps</b>. That folder needs to be copied to <b>/PALM/Programs</b> on your SD card.</p>
	<p><i>The name of the data folder is displayed for your convenience.</i></p>

	<h3>Notes</h3>
	<p>Your Zodiac must have <a href="/files/popaccess/dl/PopAccess.prc">PopAccess</a> to play unsigned games.</p>
			
	<p>In Zodiac apps with file browsers, you'll see some junk files that start with a period. Mac OSX puts these files all over the card. They're supposed to be invisible, but the Z can see them. Download <a href="http://www.zeroonetwenty.com/blueharvest/" target="_blank">Blueharvest</a> to clean them.</p>
