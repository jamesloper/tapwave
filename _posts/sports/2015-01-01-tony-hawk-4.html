Tony Hawk 4 for the Zodiac is set up a bit differently than the full-3D console versions. This one plays via an isometric view with primarily 2D backgrounds. The Zodiac port seems to be hit or miss depending on your tastes, but watch the video to see for yourself. I'm a bit on the fence with this one--I still need to give it more time.
