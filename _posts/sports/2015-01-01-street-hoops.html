Street Hoops is a streetball video game released in 2002. The game has real life streetballers such as 1/2 Man 1/2 Amazing, Hot Sauce, and Headache, and is a less dramatic, more realistic game than NBA Street, as the characters cannot jump completely over the hoop. Like NBA Street, it is possible to create custom baller, and play on real life courts. The game has 3 different modes: World Tournament, Lord of the Court, and Pick-up Game.
