PopAccess 3 was created after Tapwave went into bankruptcy. Since Tapwave had previously required all games to be "signed" before they could be released, there had to be some way to get past this so that further Zodiac development could happen. DevAccess was cracked in a few weeks, then Popov made user enhancements to it.
