Orbz is an action/arcade game set in colorful 3D environments. The object of the game is to shoot your orb at targets located throughout 14 distinct courses in a race to score the most points. Game play contains both intense action and also strategy in planning the best scoring shots. Power-ups, like the "Money Shot" and "Curse of the Goober," are also available to either give you a scoring advantage or to slow down your opponents. In Solo Mode, you complete a series of progressively difficult challenges that focus on scoring the most points in different scenarios. Bronze, Silver, and Gold medals are awarded for high scores. For every 5 gold medals achieved, the player will also unlock a fancy new Orb to use in Solo or Multiplayer mode. The Multiplayer Mode allows 2 Orbz players to compete against each other over a local Bluetooth network. Select a course to play, number of rounds in the match, and a time limit.
