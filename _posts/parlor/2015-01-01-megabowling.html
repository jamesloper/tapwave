The action is so realistic that you will be able to hone your bowling skills whenever you have a few minutes to spare. Pick your level of skill, from beginner to expert, and test your game against an opponent or the computer. On-screen scoring, realistic pin ball and pin action and cheers from the crowd when you throw a strike will keep you coming back for more. Simply use your finger or stylus on your touchscreen to bowl a strike in either portrait or landscape screen position.
