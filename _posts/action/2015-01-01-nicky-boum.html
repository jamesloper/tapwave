Nicky Boum is a classic platformer game initially designed for the Amiga. The game was published by Microids in 1992 and was also ported to the Atari ST and PC EGA platforms. This project aims to rewrite the original engine of the game and requires the original datafiles. This rewrite is based on the reversing of the Amiga and PC versions. The engine initially designed for Nicky Boum was re-used, along with several modifications in 2 games also distributed by Microids : Nicky 2 (1993) and Carlos (1994). Currently, only Nicky Boum and Nicky 2 are playable with this project.
