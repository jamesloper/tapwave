Test your wit and reflexes with ZapEm, a dual-mode action puzzler developed exclusively for the Zodiac from Vicious Bytes. ZapEm has two modes of play, Action Zap and Brain Zap. Action Zap mode is filled with fast-action that ends only where your skills do. Pieces approach your space and challenge you to ZapEm. Brain Zap mode is a puzzle game with stationary pieces that you must clear with a limited number of Zaps. Easy to learn but difficult to master -- that's ZapEm!
