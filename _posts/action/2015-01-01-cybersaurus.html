Cybersaurus is a thrilling new action game from Darxun Games for Palm OS 5.2 and later devices. The game's storyline is a hodgepodge of elements inspired by Beast Wars-era Transformers and the BattleTech/MechWarrior universe. The game's tired storyline consists of your Raptor 9000 mech being the Earth's only hope against a race of evil Robosaurs. The mechanized Robosaurs civilization used Earth's original Dinosaurs as inspiration for their sleek, metallic instruments of destruction. Now in the year 2513 they have returned to reclaim the planet for themselves. Of course, the primary role here is action-packed gameplay so any storyline shortcomings can be forgiven.
