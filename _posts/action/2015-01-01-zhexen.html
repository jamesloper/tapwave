Following the tale of D'Sparil's defeat in Heretic, Hexen takes place in another realm, Cronos, which is besieged by the second of the Serpent Riders, Korax. Three heroes set out to destroy Korax. The player assumes the role of one such hero. In the course of his quest he travels through elemental dungeons, a wilderness region, a mountainside seminary, a large castle and finally a necropolis.
