Just one ship against an invading alien armada - FireHammer brings the traditional vertical shoot 'em up experience to the Zodiac! Survival is a matter of lightning-fast reflexes as you guide your space fighter through swarms of enemy projectiles and take on the slowly advancing fleet of enemy battleships. Collect power-ups to improve your weapons, and activate the experimental super weapon to help you out of tight spots. FireHammer also features a bonus chain score multiplier system, which allows the truly hardcore pilots to duke it out on the online ranking list.
