Destined to be a classic, it's an arcade-style, space-shooter game where you race to run a series of waypoints unlocked by keys found in devices -- called Xploids. You can destroy these Xploids with rail-guns, seekers, crushing shields, repulsors and other power-ups. Choose your pilot and hone your skills while competing for the global high-score. Advanced levels unleash enemy ships that will compete to close the waypoints you're trying to keep open! It's a high-speed rapid paced game with hours of unlimited gameplay.
