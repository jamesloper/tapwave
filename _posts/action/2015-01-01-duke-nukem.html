Duke Nukem 3D features the adventures of the titular macho Duke Nukem, voiced by Jon St. John, who fights against an alien invasion on Earth. Along with Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, Duke Nukem 3D is considered responsible for popularizing first-person shooters. It was released to major acclaim. Reviewers praised the interactivity of the environment, level design, gameplay, and unique risqu? humor, a mix of pop-culture satire and lampooning of over-the-top Hollywood action heroes.
