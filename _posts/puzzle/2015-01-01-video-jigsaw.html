On a Treo this would take live video from the camera and make a live jigsaw puzzle of it. When used without a camera it switches to the built-in animation - randomly generated "city" view with fireworks and spotlights reflecting in water. On most new new devices you can also use the third option - turn your personal photos into puzzles (requires the Palm/PalmOne Media application or Tapwave Zodiac Photos application)
