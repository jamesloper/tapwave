You'll be put in the middle of a thriving landscape of cities. In order to become the transportation tycoon, you'll need to build trains, planes, ships, and automobiles and send them off to make you rich. Transport coal to the power station for top dollar, or logs to the sawmill to produce goods. Take those goods to a nearby city and cash in, but don't forget to pick up passengers waiting at the bus station! From advertising to construction, you'll do it all with up to 7 computer opponents all wanting to be the next tycoon!
