 * A lot of pdb files in the IRdatabases folder.
   These are IR databases with infrared codes (called codebases) used for controlling
   popular home entertainment devices (TV, VCR, DVD, Audio, etc.). Please install them
   to your handheld  memory.

I M P O R T A N T. Do not install codebases on the expansion card.

TIPS FOR INSTALLING IR CODEBASES:

1) When installing NoviiRemote software for the first time, it's best to install all the
codebases. Later you can easy remove unused codebases from your handheld.

2) Copy the pdb files in the IRdatabases folder to the internal memory of your handheld by
selecting all the files, then dragging and dropping them onto the Install window in your
Palm Desktop on your computer.

3) If you're not going to install all the codebases, please pay attention to the codebase
names. 
Prefix TV  denotes codebases used for controlling TV Sets,
prefix CAB denotes codebases used for controlling satellite and cable receivers,
prefix DVD denotes codebases used for controlling DVD and CD devices,
prefix VCR denotes codebases used for controlling VCR devices,
prefix Tiv denotes codebases used for controlling PVR/DVR devices like TiVo,
prefix AUD denotes codebases used for controlling audio devices (receivers, amplifiers, etc.).

4) Important. If you have a trial or previous version of NoviiRemote already installed on
your handheld, you should not install pre-built codebases. They can overwrite your customized
codebases.

5) We've created a forum where people who have lost their original remote controls or who
have broken remotes can download codebases created by other customers. Please visit our
website at the following address:
