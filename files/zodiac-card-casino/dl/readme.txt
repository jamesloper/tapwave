Overall Gameplay
----------------
At the beginning of each game you will be asked to place your bet.  Use UP/DOWN to
change your bet and press A(BLUE) when you're ready to play.  If you want to leave the
current game, either press B(YELLOW) or set your bet to 0.

Many prompts require you to press a button to continue, so if you're in doubt,
press B(YELLOW) or A(BLUE) to continue.


Video Poker
-----------
At the beginning of the game you will be dealt 5 cards.  You will then be able to
HOLD as many of the 5 cards as you want.  To hold a card, use Left/Right on the
joystick to select a card and then press A(BLUE) to toggle the HOLD status.  Once you
have your holds set up, then press B(YELLOW) to continue.  You will then be dealt new cards
to replace any cards that you didn't HOLD.  If you want to know what a hands will
pay what, you may press D(RED) to see the payout table.

Any time that you win money, you will be able to attempt to try to double your
winnings.  If you choose to attempt this, 5 cards will be dealt out.  The face-up
card is the dealer's card.  You may choose any of the 4 face-down cards and if it
is higher in value than the dealer's, you double your winnings.  If it's lower,
you lose all your winnings, and if it's the same value, you keep your winnings.


BlackJack
---------
I will not go into a tutorial about the game of BlackJack, but I will give a quick
and dirty overview of the game.  The objective of the game is to get as close to 21
as possible without going over.  If you go over, you lose.  You and the dealer are
both dealt two cards, but one of the dealer's cards is face down.  Then, you are
able to act on your hand.  The basic options are Hit or Stand.  If you hit, you get
another card.  If you stand, your turn is over.

If you get a BlackJack (21 with only 2 cards) then your turn will be over.

If the dealer is showing an Ace, you will be asked if you want insurance.  If you
take insurance, you will ante 1/2 of your current bet.  If the dealer has
BlackJack, you win twice the insurance bet.  If he does not, then you lose your
insurance bet.

Only when you have 2 cards in your hand, you will be given the "Double Down"
option.  If you double down, you will double your bet and get a SINGLE extra card.
Once you get that card, your turn is over.

If your two-card hand is a pair of the same cards, you will be given the option to
SPLIT.  If you SPLIT, you will take each of the cards and start 2 new hands.  You 
will also have to pay for the new hand.

Once you have completed your hands, then the dealer will play his hand.  If you
have busted (gone over 21) on all of your hands, he will not take any new cards.
Otherwise, he will draw new cards as long as his hand value is less than 17.


Poker Solitaire
---------------
This game is similar to Video Poker in that you try to make 5-card poker hands.
The main difference is that you have 4 hands at once, and how you fill the hands
is the whole game.  You will start out with one card in each hand.  Then, you are
dealt one card and you can choose which hand you want to place this card on.  The
difficult part is that you may not put the card in any hand that already has more
cards than any other hand.  So, for example, if hand 1 has two cards, but hands 
2, 3, and 4 only have a single card in them, then you may not put the new card in
hand 1.  You could only place it in hand 2, 3, or 4.

The payouts in Poker Solitaire are based on the same payout scale as Video Poker,
but there is one main twist.  Your overall payout has to be in a full increment
of your original bet.  So, if you bet $100, you could win $0,$100,$200,$300, etc.
If you bet $100, you could not win $175, so your winnings then would be $100.
