<p>Climb aboard your very own Apache Longbow or Mi-24 Hind helicopter and start to make a difference in this Cold War inspired arcade combat simulator from Pazzazz, the same development team who brought you <b>GTS Racing Challenge</b>.</p>

<P>Hellfire Features:
<ul>
<li>Worldwide missions to complete, including multiple objectives per mission.</li>
<li>Varied enemies and prisoners of war to rescue</li>
<li>Choice of Apache AH64A/D Longbow or MiL Mi-24 D Hind helicopters, both with realistic weapon loadouts and capabilities.</li>
<li>Full realtime rendered terrain and enemies, along with high quality pre-rendered helicopter models.</li>
<li>Dynamic sound effects.</li>
<li>Varied gameplay with multiple levels of challenge.</li> 
<li>Fully configurable control system.</li>
<li>Palm OS® 5.0 or above (high resolution), Windows Mobile™ for Pocket PC.</li>
</UL></P><h2 class='docHeading'>How To Install</h2>


<p>Use an extractor program such as <b><A HREF="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</A></b> on the PC or <b><A HREF="http://www.stuffit.com">Stuffit Expander</A></b> (on the Mac) to get at the Hellfire files. 

Install the game by double-clicking the <i>.prc</i> file, which opens the Palm <I>Install Tool</I> program.</p>

<p>Use the <b>HotSync</b> button as usual to install the game onto your handheld. If you have a handheld with an expansion card, you can then move the game over to it. Do this before you register the game!</p>

<p>Now run <b>Hellfire</b> and tap the screen to play the game!</p>
<p>If you've got any queries about 
Hellfire or the registration process, first
check out our <b><a href="http://www.astraware.com/help/">knowledge base</a></b>
on our website (you must be connected to the
internet to access this). If this doesn't help, get in touch with us at 
<b><a href="mailto:support@astraware.com">support@astraware.com</a></b>.
If you've got any questions (or suggestions, we love those) about the game
itself, please get in touch with us at the email address at the top of this
page.</p>

<h2 class='docHeading'>Quick Start!</h2>
<P><B>Follow these instructions to get straight into the cockpit!</B></P>
<UL>
<LI>From the opening screen, tap to proceed to get to the menu
<LI>On the main menu (the "Select Mode" menu), tap on "Trial"
<LI>On the next screen, ("Select Level"), tap on either "Sergeant" or "Lieutenant"
<LI>Tap on the USSR MiL Mi-24 Hind, and then on "Accept" on the next screen
<LI>View the briefing, and hit "Play" to get into the action!
<LI>You can review your objectives at any point in the game, by tapping on the mini-map in the top right corner!
</UL><h2 class='docHeading'>Controls</h2>
<P>Hellfire features fully reconfigurable controls on all devices (including support support for the Sony GC-10), so it is highly recommened that you visit the Options menu and define a set of controls that most suit you and your device.  There 
is a basic mapping of the controls which will be functional on most devices, but given the many different physical configurations and internal button identifcations, you may find that not all functions work 
with the default mapping as expected.</P>

<h3 class='docHeading'>Landing</H3>
<P>If you have not assigned a separate button to landing, you can land by choosing the "Mode: Airborne" item from the weapons selection, and then press Fire to land.  Once you have landed, this will change to "Mode: Landed", press Fire again 
to take off.</P>

<P>You can also assign a button to land, allowing you to land or take off simply by pressing this button.  <B>Note:</B> If a button has been assigned to Land, then the "Mode: " option will no longer appear in the weapon selection menus

<h3 class='docHeading'>Graffiti Controls</H3>
<P>It is possible to fly the helicopter by moving the stylus around the graffiti area.  Centre of the visible graffiti area (not necessarily the same as the line dividing letters from numbers) is the "neutral" point, where it will not affect the motion of 
the helicopter at all.  Moving the stylus forward from this point will accelerate your forwards, and moving it backwards from this point will decelerate and then start moving the helicopter backwards.  Turn left and right by moving the stylus left 
and right on the graffiti area. </P><h2 class='docHeading'>Hints and Tips</h2>
<P>As any good helicopter pilot knows, you have to fly very low to avoid enemy radar and high flying patrols.  This means you are going to have to go around those trees pilot, rather than over them!</P>

<P>The USSR MiL Mi-24 Hind has a much larger bay for carrying equipment and passengers than the AH-64A/D Apache Longbow.  This means that the Hind may carry up to six rescued personnel at once, whereas the Apache can carry only 4 at once.  You may have to make more than one trip 
to get everyone!</P>

<P>If you crash while carrying any personnel, they will not be lost, but will instead appear with your replacement helicopter.</P>







<h2 class='docHeading'>Registering</h2>
<P>If you downloaded the game straight from the internet, from Astraware's web pages, or from one of the popular handheld download sites, then your copy is in 'Demo' form. Demo means that you can play free for a while, and then decide whether to register it or not.</P>

<P>In Demo form, you can play Hellfire for free, as you decide whether you like it or not. After each time you play, the program will display a short message asking you to register or purchase a full version!</P>

<P><B>Registering Online:</B></P>

<P>For those that like the speed and convenience of buying of the internet, when you register for the game, you'll get a key which will unlock the game and remain valid for future upgrades. Go to the web page at 
<A HREF="http://www.astraware.com/palm/hellfire/">http://www.astraware.com/palm/hellfire/</A> for more details. </P>

<P>You'll need to know your <A HREF="http://www.astraware.com/help/showQuestion?keyword=HotSyncID">HotSync ID</A> which you can find by running Hellfire, and selecting "Register" from the "Options" menu item.  
Your HotSync ID (or username) will be filled in for you.  You can also find it by tapping on the "HotSync" icon of your Palm, and looking in the top right hand corner of the screen.</P>

<P>When you register, Astraware will generate a key based on your ID, which will normally be sent out by email within 48 hours of you registering. When you receive your key, go to the same register option, and enter the key into the space 
provided. </P>
