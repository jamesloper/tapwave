REQUIREMENTS:

-PalmOS 5.2 or superior

-200 Mhz processor speed required, 400 Mhz recommended.


- 2.6 MB of free RAM for the trial version and 3.1 MB
  for the full version.
  You also need 4 Mb of free RAM AFTER install 
  to run the game.
  
  
'CYBERSAURUS' is not compatible with handhelds 
running version of PalmOS® previous than 5.2


INSTALLATION:

Unzip and install cybersaurus.prc and cbs_arch.pdb.
Note that you can install on card but on some devices (I.E. T5,Lifedrive,Treo650) 
it causes problems.
If it is your case please install it on internal RAM.


USAGE:

Navigate the menu using pen. 
You can reconfigure keys in the Options->Key setup page.
At that point you can also navigate menus using keys.


If you are using a slow device you can improve the frame rate deactivating
some of the features in the 'options' page.
For example ,for a 200 Mhz processor I recommend to turn off the background and to 
reduce the visibility distance in order to get a playable frame rate.
