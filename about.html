<h2>Tapwave Zodiac Game Install Process</h2>

<p style="padding-bottom:55px;">
For the longest time we all used to use <b>HotSync</b>, a program similar to iTunes to set up and install files to the Zodiac. Honestly, today's method is actually a bit easier.

<p>
Many apps are packaged as just a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRC_(Palm_OS)" target="_blank">.prc</a> and possibly a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDB_(Palm_OS)" target="_blank">.pdb</a> file as well. Just copy these to <b>/PALM/Launcher</b> on your SD card and you're good to go.
</p>

<p>
If an app has a required game data folder there will also be a folder in the download. It will have a name like <b>Zod-fcps</b>. That folder needs to be copied to <b>/PALM/Programs</b> on your SD card.</p>

<p>
<i>The name of the data folder is displayed for your convenience.</i>
</p>

<h2>PopAccess</h2>
<p>You need to have <a href="/popaccess-3">PopAccess</a> on your Zodiac to run most games.

<h2>Mac OSX</h2>
<p>
Sometimes, especially in Zodiac apps with file browsers, you'll see some junk files that start with a period. Mac OSX puts these files all over the card for reasons we don't care about. Download <a href="http://www.zeroonetwenty.com/blueharvest/" target="_blank">Blueharvest</a> to clean them.
